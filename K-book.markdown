  <div id="left" style="float:left; width:48%;"> <p>This book is planned to be an introduction to algebraic K-theory and its role in algebraic geometry viewed through the lens of intersection theory.</p>

<p>
The target audience for this book are graduate students in algebraic geometry with a good background in commutative algebra who have had some exposure to both scheme theory and homological algebra.

<p>
This is an ongoing project (with no set date for completion). In the spring of 2025, I taught a one quarter course on algebraic K-theory using this book. Some of the proofs have been updated. If you have any comments, corrections, or suggestions, please let me know about them!
