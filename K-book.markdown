  <div id="left" style="float:left; width:48%;"> <p>This book is planned to be an introduction to algebraic K-theory and its role in algebraic geometry viewed through the lens of intersection theory.</p>

<p>
The target audience for this book are graduate students in algebraic geometry with a good background in commutative algebra who have had some exposure to both scheme theory and homological algebra.

This is an ongoing project (with no set date for completion â€” I mostly work on it when it sounds fun). If you have any comments, corrections, or suggestions, please let me know about them!
